# liri-node-app
 LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Often times, people are interested in finding out more information about a song that they enjoy, their favorite artist, or a popular new movie. Instead of having to search for that information in separate places, the Liri bot combines all of those components in one user friendly place. 

The Liri bot is organized into 3 main files: liri.js (which contains the javascript code), keys.js (which contains the API keys needed for the program to run, also linked to an .env file), and a random.txt file (which helps one part of the app function). It is organized in this way in order to allow users of the app to see the funcionality without the data sensitive material. 

How to Use Liri Bot: In order to use this app, you will need use node.js in association with your computer's command line.
